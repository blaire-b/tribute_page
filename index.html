              <p>The sun is the main energy source for planet earth. It provides seemingly unlimitied amounts of heat and light, provides food to plants through photosynthesis, and is essential to sustain life on earth. In addition, the sun provides vitamin D, an essential vitamin that humans need to feel their best. Sunshine also has an effect on moods. Many people experience Seasonal Affective Disorder in the winter because of fewer sunlight hours combined with increased cloud cover.</p>
              <p>In recent years, the use of solar panels to power homes and businesses has become more popular. While the cost of solar panels remains high, we may see increased investment in them in the future, as people look for more environmentally friendly ways to live. </p>
